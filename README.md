# Agile-Software-Development-Course-W-Udacity
I am using this repo to take notes and document my learning journey and experience as I seek to use the agile approach on my tasks as a Data/Business Analyst.

Agile emerged as a solution to the business crisis of the early 1990s when it was taking 2 to 4 years to deliver software solutions, but user needs were beginning to change fast the need for another method of development that focuses on:

1.Business Users

2.Business Value

Agile tools:
Agile tools make for excellent communication and collaboration on projecsts. They:

1.Help monitor the teams’ progress in a transparent and visible manner

2.Can be customized to accommodate Agile teams in various industries with different Agile frameworks

3.Provide real-time dashboards and reports that show the Agile team’s progress against the product roadmap

**Explain why Agile is necessary for complex product development**

Agile accelerates product development cycles

Agile teams can release products 50 to 80% faster than teams with more traditional approach to product development.

**Differentiate between being agile and doing agile**

Some organizations and Agile Teams unfortunately just focus on Doing Agile. This equates to simply adopting the practices without committing to or exhibiting agile principles and values.

Being Agile is the foundation that truly elevates individuals, teams, and organizations to unleash their latent potential to deliver monumental and focused value.

**Diffrentiate between agile and waterfall approaches and where each makes sense**

# Efficiency vs effectiveness: 

If you’re only focused on going fast, you prioritize efficiency, if you’re trying to focus on innovation, creativity, and making sure you’re working on the right thing, you need to focus on effectiveness.

Agile ensures a balanced approach whereby Agile Teams ensure there is a balance between speed and creativity.

**New terms**

VUCA: Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity

Volatility: Volatility is when there are unexpected or unstable possibilities that may influence the work being done

Uncertainty: The extent to which an organization can confidently predict or forecast the future; more uncertainty makes it harder to predict

Complexity: Complexity exists when there are many interconnected parts and variables that influence each other

Ambiguity: Ambiguity refers to a lack of clarity, such as not having a clear understanding of the genuine needs of the customer and end-users

Muda: Lean principles refer to the Japanese term Muda as waste; Agile teams focus on the removal of non-value adding tasks that are seen as Muda

Agilist combine systems thinking with a growth mindset to deliver optimal business value. While traditional thinking looks at parts of a problem separately, systems thinking is a holistic approach that looks at the way a system's components interrelate and influence each other and how these components come together within the context of larger systems to deliver a solution

**Agile:** is a set of principles that guide how we as individuals, as teams and as organizations think about, as well as act upon the work that we do.

Business agility is the ability of an organization to:

Adapt quickly to market changes
Respond rapidly and flexibly to customer demands that make business sense
Adapt and lead change productively and cost-effectively with no compromise to quality
